            <p class="text-lg px-8 text-white ">
                Dogs, with their incredible sense of smell, can detect the scent of a missing person from afar, even if that person is hidden by bushes or other obstacles.
                This allows them to excel in finding individuals during search and rescue missions.

                Training a dog is not a solo endeavor. It requires the collective effort of numerous individuals investing countless hours in diverse training activities.
                This collaborative commitment is essential to attaining the proficiency necessary for a qualified team capable of aiding in the search for a missing person.

            <p class="text-lg px-8 text-white ">
                Search dogs see their job not as work but instead as a game that they love more than anything else.
                When the dog finds what they are looking for they are rewarded with a prized toy or invaluable treat.
