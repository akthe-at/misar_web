                    Dogs have a far better ability to smell than do humans and they can pick up the scent of a missing person from a
                    distance and if that person happens to be covered by brush or other materials that would prevent locating a
                    person visually.

                    No one trains a dog on their own. It takes many people and many hours of varying training to achieve the level
                    of competence for a team that is qualified to assist in the search for a missing person.

                    The dogs consider searching their favorite 'game' just as do dogs who love to chase a ball or frisbee. Finding
                    what they're looking for brings a reward - generally either a food treat or a toy.
