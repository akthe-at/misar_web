                <li>Michigan Search and Rescue is a 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation.</li>
                <li>Members of MISAR are not paid or compensated for their services in any form.</li>
                <li>
                    The organization operates solely on donations received from the public, grants, and through grass-roots fundraising efforts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Members are expected to pay for and maintain their own equipment with their own money on top of the costs associated with traveling to searches or training.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, canine handlers on the team must provide and care for their canine with their own money. The canines are not property of the organization unlike many law enforcement canines.

            We are always looking for people to help with training. If you are a scout troop leader or if you have a day to donate to "get lost for the dogs" we welcome your participation.
            Are you interested in becoming involved in search and rescue? We will be happy to invite you out for a day of training so you can see if it's right for you.
